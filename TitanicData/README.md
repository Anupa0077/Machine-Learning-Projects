# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Project Overview
In this project, I implemented a logistic regression model to predict the chances of survival of passengers on the Titanic. The goal was to identify which factors influenced survival rates and to build a model that can make accurate predictions.

## Key Features
- **Data Analysis**: Explored and analyzed the Titanic dataset to understand the impact of various factors on survival chances.
- **Feature Selection**: Identified and selected the most relevant features for the model.
- **Model Implementation**: Developed a logistic regression model to predict survival.
- **Model Evaluation**: Achieved an accuracy of 78% in predicting survival.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset, which includes information about the passengers such as age, gender, class, and more.

## Results
The logistic regression model was able to predict the survival of passengers with an accuracy of 78%. Key factors influencing survival included:
- **Passenger Class**: Higher class passengers had better survival rates.
- **Gender**: Females had higher survival rates compared to males.
- **Age**: Younger passengers had better chances of survival.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of logistic regression in predicting binary outcomes and highlights the importance of feature selection in model performance.
