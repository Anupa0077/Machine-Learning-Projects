# Student Performance Prediction
This project aims to predict student performance using a neural network model. The model achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.2.

## Overview
This repository contains the code and datasets used for predicting student performance based on various features. The goal is to identify factors that influence student success and provide insights for educational improvements.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes features such as:

1. Study Hours

2. Sleep Hours

3. Motivation

And many more

## Model
The model is built using a neural network architecture. Key features include:

Input layers representing various student features

Multiple hidden layers with ReLU activation

Output layer for predicted performance

## Results
The model achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.2, indicating high accuracy in predicting student performance.
